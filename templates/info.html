        <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that 
            affects how your body turns food into energy.
        </p>
        <p>Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and 
            releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
        </p>
        <p>With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. 
            When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar 
            stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, 
            such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            There isn’t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help.
        </p>
        <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
            Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). 
            This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes 
            have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, 
            teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. 
            Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
            With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal 
            levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is 
            usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). 
            You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re 
            at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, 
            such as:
            <br>
            - Losing weight.<br>
            - Eating healthy food.<br>
            - Being active.
        </p>
        <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. 
            If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. 
            Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born. However, it increases your 
            risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or 
            teen and develop type 2 diabetes later in life.
        </p>
        <h3>Prediabetes</h3>
        <p>
            In the United States, 96 million adults—more than 1 in 3—have prediabetes. 
            More than 8 in 10 of them don’t know they have it. With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher 
            than normal, but not high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes raises your risk for 
            type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But there’s good news. If you have prediabetes, 
            a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program can help you take healthy steps to reverse it.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 37.3 million people who have diabetes in the US alone. Diabetes is a very misunderstood disease and is just as important as any other disease. 
            The purpose of this app is to help track blood sugar and insulin entries as well as help add up food entries to return the calorie and carbs counts.
